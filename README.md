# My Personal Website

### Description 
I created this website to simply showcase my other projects and social media links, I ended up making a more creative website then I originally planned for.  I chose to use React as I was planning on making a one page website with different scroll sections where I could utilize Reacts reausable components.

### Still in Progress
- adding a seperate page for the rest of my smaller projects
- update hero page to have movement
- nav bar to blend in to top
